### Detailed Schedule

| Duration | Activity |
|:---------|:---------|
| **10 min** | **Introduction**<br><em>Motivation, limitations of centralized personalization, and overview of PKG-driven decentralization.</em> |
| **30 min** | **Personal Knowledge Graph Foundations**<br><em>PKG representation, provenance, schema alignment, and examples (FoodKG, Health and Finance PKGs).</em> |

| **20 min** | **Semantic–Neural Personalization**<br><em>Rule-guided KG adaptation, behavioral alignment, and filter-bubble mitigation.</em> |
| **20 min** | **Knowledge-Graph-Grounded RAG Pipelines**<br><em>Parallel and multi-stage retrieval; building compact personalized contexts.</em> |
| **60 min** | **Hands-On Exercise**<br>Participants use provided Jupyter notebooks to:<br>• Build a small PKG using RDFLib<br>• Run a toy federated personalization flow using Flower<br>• Execute KG-based retrieval for LLM prompting |
| **30 min** | **Discussion and Q&A** |

**Total Duration: 3 hours 20 minutes**
