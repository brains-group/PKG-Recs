## About

This tutorial will be presented at the [23rd European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2026)](https://2026.eswc-conferences.org/) in Dubrovnik, Croatia, May 10-14, 2026.

### Abstract

Personalization today is dominated by centralized systems that require extensive user data collection, raising critical concerns about privacy, autonomy, transparency, and user agency. At the same time, advances in semantic technologies, especially Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs), offer rich, interpretable, user-centric structures for modeling preferences, behaviors, and context. This tutorial presents the emerging paradigm of decentralized personalization, which brings together PKGs, federated learning, privacy-preserving computation, blockchain-based trust infrastructures, and large language models (LLMs). Participants will learn how PKGs can anchor personalization while ensuring data sovereignty, how decentralized learning architectures operate, how semantic–neural hybrid recommenders are constructed, and how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines can leverage personal and exogenous knowledge graphs.
